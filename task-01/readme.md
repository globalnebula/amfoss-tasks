# 🧙‍♂️:Terminal Wizard:🧙‍♂️
I found this task enjoyable. The first three steps were quite straightforward, but I encountered some difficulties when the second half required me to "push" my progress to my GitHub account. I wasn't familiar with this concept, and I hesitated for a while because I didn't want to make any mistakes by attempting something I didn't understand. Eventually, I decided to look up what to do, and I realized that it was actually quite easy and quick.

Returning to this task after completing several others, I genuinely appreciate it as it helped me grasp basic terminal commands, just as the task's readme had mentioned. Initially, I wasn't entirely sure what that meant, but now I understand the value of using online resources for learning and problem-solving. 😄👍
