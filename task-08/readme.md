# Poke-Search!
This was a very interesting task so I thought of starting with this,I knew it wasn't going to be that easy.Initially,I started doing it and it felt fine for a while,but then I was bombarded with some timeout error whenever i tried to capture a pokemon.Well later figured out with the help of a mentor that it wasn't responding because Jio,for some reason was blocking that website.Later changed to airtel and it worked fine.
Started with adding the background image and displaying the stats by recieving stuff from the API.After all that i worked on the css like styling the buttons,"enter" "previous" "next" the way it was displayed in the demo that u gave in the github repo.
Displaying the pokemons that i captured in a new window was slightly a tricky task.Had to work for a lot of time figuring out that part.And after completing almost the whole task,i felt the pictures i have used are like low quality pics and i have to use the official artwork.So changed my codes according to that and that consumed a bit of my time too.
The biggest blocker for me was the point where i had to hide the background on clicking the enter button when displaying stats.Worked alot on it but it didnt work.Tried 3 methods for hiding that background but unfortunately no change.
Will edit my readme file if i manage to do that.
